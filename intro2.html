                        <br>
                        <p>When I joined GAZE in April, September seemed a mighty long way off, yet here we are already! Stepping into such a brilliant team ensured that an intense challenge has also been a genuine pleasure, and so my first task is to thank the full GAZE team. Thanks also to my new working partners outside the festival who showed patience and kindness as I learned on the job – I couldn’t have got here without you.
                            <br><br>
                            We all know it can be a bit tricky when gays turn 30, but we’re feeling fit as a fiddle and ready to welcome back audiences with smart, innovative queer cinema for all. At the festival’s heart is our packed five-day cinema programme with long-term partners IFI and Light House Cinema.
                            <br><br>
                            For this milestone anniversary year I also had permission and encouragement to programme a little outside the box. Given the sheer quantity of fantastic films on offer, this was an opportunity I grabbed with both hands. So this year you will also find a GAZE Culture Night special, a programme of new queer films screening for free at The Complex Gallery, curated with myself and Caoimhe Lavelle, plus a selection of GAZE Online films you can curate and enjoy yourself from anywhere in Ireland. We hope these new evolving platforms bring LGBTQ+ film to more audiences than ever before. Tell us what you think!
                            <br><br>
                            As GAZE looks back at its history, two themes for the festival naturally presented themselves. Firstly, to honour the legacies of our LGBTQ+ forebears in art, sex, activism and life. That’s why you’ll find queer classics curated by very special guests: Tonie Walsh brings Gregg Araki’s explosive The Living End, while Ruth McCarthy offers Cheryl Dunye’s super-hot and hilarious Mommy Is Coming. Plus our Friday night late is none other than John Waters’ iconic Pink Flamingos – and if you think we’re looking good at 30, Flamingos is 50 and as horribly good as it ever was! Other queer pioneers and their tales of joy and endurance pop up across the programme. Watch and give love to the ancestors.
                            <br><br>
                            Our other theme comes from the very roots of the festival: the art of film itself. Our shorts programmes queer a selection of themes which celebrate this aspect of GAZE, namely The Art of Cruising, The Art of Dress, The Art of Experience, and The Art of Imagination. Each programme brings a diversity of film around a shared concept with outrageous, sexy, imaginative and touching results. Thanks to our brilliant Junior Programmers James Hudson and Alice Linehan for their co-curation, and thanks also to aemi who have yet again devised for you a beautiful set of shorts under their banner of Making & Unmaking.  You will love it.
                            <br><br>
                            Everything else I want to recommend to you is in the carefully written prose that follows, and also watch out for my own Director’s Spotlights recommendations where I flag films that have especially moved and inspired me during this year’s programming experience. But needless to say, if it’s in the festival, it’s something we have fallen in love with, and we hope you will too.
                            <br><br>
                            If you see me any time between festival launch and festival finish, come and say hello, I’d love to meet you. Enjoy GAZE 2022, and happy 30th to us all!
