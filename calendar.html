                            <span>Wednesday 29th September<br>Screening at 20:00 & 20:10<br> IFI<br><br></span>

                            <em>Narrative, USA, 2021<br> Dir. Lauren Hadaway<br> 1h 34m</em>
                            <br><br>
                            Fresh from an award-winning run at the Tribeca film festival, Lauren Hadaway's accomplished debut asks at what point does human drive become a dangerous psychological game? Alex is a young queer college student driven to make it onto her university's rowing team. Classes, parties, love interests, and even her own state of mind come second to her pursuit of athletic perfection, as those around her powerlessly try to intervene. Hadaway's cinematic story is tightly wound with a commanding performance from Isabelle Furhman (horror fans will recall her memorable role in 2009's Orphan).
                             
                            The Novice takes the familiar queer story of self-determination and personal strength and dashes it with the psychological-thriller and flecks of horror.  Once you see The Novice, the rowing machine will never quite be the same again. Altogether now: 'legs-body-arms, arms-body-legs!' A perfect opener to GAZE 2021 and a welcome reminder of what queer cinema is all about.
